## A tennis scoreboard by React/Redux / [DEMO](http://tennis-scoreboard.surge.sh/)
A tennis scoreboard UI by React.js

In summer 2017, I went to Rogers cup in Toronto, and I saw the scoreboard that has a very nice UI. 

So, that's the reason this project was created. I use React and Redux to reach this project.
